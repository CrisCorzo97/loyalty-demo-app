		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Core Stack",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of the project repository and core stack into subtasks such as: initializing the Next.js project, configuring the App Router, installing and configuring Tailwind CSS, integrating Shadcn/ui, setting up Prisma with Supabase PostgreSQL, integrating Clerk authentication, and preparing the initial README and project structure.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves initializing a modern Next.js project with the latest App Router, integrating multiple frameworks (Tailwind, Shadcn/ui), setting up a database with Prisma and Supabase, and configuring Clerk for authentication. Each integration has its own configuration steps and potential pitfalls, especially with the new App Router's learning curve and the need for seamless authentication and database setup[1][3][4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication and User Roles",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks such as: configuring Clerk registration and login, defining user roles in the Prisma schema, implementing role assignment logic, setting up session management, and enforcing role-based access control.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing authentication and user roles requires integrating Clerk, updating the database schema, and ensuring secure session and access control logic. While Clerk simplifies some aspects, role management and access control add moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Business Profile Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down business profile management into subtasks: designing the business profile form, implementing create/edit functionality, linking businesses to merchant users, and handling CRUD operations in the backend.",
			"reasoning": "This task is a standard CRUD implementation with user association, which is moderately complex but well-understood in full-stack development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Reward Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand reward management into subtasks: designing the reward management UI, implementing create/edit/delete logic, linking rewards to businesses, and setting up condition logic for earning rewards.",
			"reasoning": "Reward management involves CRUD operations and some business logic for reward conditions, which adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Consumption Registration Flow",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the consumption registration flow into subtasks: building the customer search by DNI, implementing the consumption registration UI, validating input, saving consumption data, and confirming registration to the user.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires user lookup, validation, and transactional data handling, which increases complexity compared to standard CRUD."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Reward Redemption Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand reward redemption logic into subtasks: checking reward qualification, generating secure redemption codes, building the redemption UI, validating redemptions, recording redemption data, and handling edge cases (e.g., expired or already redeemed codes).",
			"reasoning": "This task involves secure code generation, validation, and transactional logic, which are more complex and require careful handling of security and data integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Consumer Portal for Reward and Consumption Tracking",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the consumer portal into subtasks: designing the portal UI, displaying reward history, showing consumption progress, and ensuring data accuracy and user experience.",
			"reasoning": "While this is mostly UI and data display, ensuring accurate aggregation and a good user experience adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Merchant Analytics Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the analytics dashboard into subtasks: defining key metrics, implementing data aggregation logic, designing dashboard UI, ensuring real-time or periodic updates, and validating metric accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "Analytics dashboards require data aggregation, visualization, and performance considerations, making this moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Commerce Discovery for Consumers",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down commerce discovery into subtasks: building the business listing page, implementing filtering and sorting, and displaying business profiles with available rewards.",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily a data listing and filtering task, which is less complex than transactional or security-focused tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Polish UI/UX and General Improvements",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand UI/UX polish into subtasks: conducting user testing, addressing usability issues, adding loading and error states, and ensuring consistent styling across the app.",
			"reasoning": "UI/UX polish involves iterative improvements and feedback handling, which can be time-consuming but is less technically complex than core feature development."
